# ReFormer

Reformer is a Ruby on Rails app made for The Odin Project curriculum. The purpose of this project was to:

- Further solifidy initial Rails configuration skills.
- Create forms using standard HTML, Rails' now soft-depreciated #form_tag helpers, as well as the Rails standard #form_with method.
- Setting up routing and controllers to create and update Users and their attributes. 
- Generating error messages when a part of the form does not pass validation.
